# qubit_efficient_QSP

This repo provides two examples of using our quantum state preparation functions.

You can directly call the QSP function (implemented in qsp_circ_construction_qubit_efficient.py) to prepare an arbitrary quantum state, as demonstrated in QSP_Method_Call_Demo.ipynb.

We also provide a detailed implementation walkthrough in [Detailed Implementation] QSP.ipynb.

We recommend first-time readers start with the walk-through in QSP_Method_Call_Demo.ipynb.

Please contact kgui@uchicago.edu if you have any questions.
