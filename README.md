# qubit_efficient_QSP

You can directly call the QSP function (implemented in qsp_circ_construction_qubit_efficient.py) to prepare an arbitrary quantum state, as demonstrated in QSP Demo.ipynb.

We also provide a detailed implementation walkthrough in [Detailed Implementation] QSP.ipynb.

Please contact kgui@uchicago.edu if you have any questions.
